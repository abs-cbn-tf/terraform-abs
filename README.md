## Terraform IAM, VPC, KMS, and Security

This repository contains Terraform code examples for managing IAM, VPC, KMS, and Security resources in AWS. These examples demonstrate how to provision and configure these resources using Terraform's infrastructure as code.

## Table of Contents

- [VPC](#vpc)
- [KMS](#kms)
- [Security](#security)

## IAM

IAM (Identity and Access Management) in AWS allows you to manage user identities and their permissions. The IAM examples in this repository demonstrate how to create IAM users, groups, and policies using Terraform. You can define user attributes, group memberships, and access policies to control who can access your AWS resources and what actions they can perform.

- [Example IAM Code](/iam/)

## VPC

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) in AWS enables you to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network. The VPC examples provided here demonstrate how to create VPCs, subnets, route tables, and associated networking components using Terraform. You can define CIDR blocks, security groups, and routing configurations to customize your VPC infrastructure.

- [Example VPC Code](/vpc/)

## KMS

KMS (Key Management Service) is a managed service in AWS that allows you to create and control encryption keys. The KMS examples included in this repository show how to create KMS keys and manage key policies using Terraform. You can specify key descriptions, deletion windows, and configure key usage permissions for secure key management.

- [Example KMS Code](/kms/)

## Security

Security in AWS involves configuring various resources to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data and applications. The security examples provided here cover topics such as creating security groups, network ACLs, and implementing security best practices using Terraform. You can define inbound and outbound rules, restrict network traffic, and manage security configurations.

## Getting Started

To use the Terraform code examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Terraform following the official [Terraform Installation Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).
3. Navigate to the specific directory for the resource you want to provision (e.g., `cd vpc` for VPC examples).
4. Initialize the Terraform project by running `terraform init`.
5. Review and customize the `.tf` files according to your requirements.
6. Run `terraform plan` to review the changes that Terraform will apply.
7. If everything looks correct, run `terraform apply` to provision the resources.
8. Verify that the resources are successfully created in your AWS account.

**Note:** Ensure that you have proper AWS credentials configured on your system, either through environment variables or the AWS CLI configuration.
