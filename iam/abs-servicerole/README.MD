This Terraform configuration sets up the AWS provider and defines an EC2 instance module. Here's a breakdown of the code:

AWS Provider Configuration:

The provider block configures the AWS provider.
Replace the region value with your desired AWS region.
Optionally, modify the profile if you are using a named profile other than the default.
EC2 Instance Module:

The module block specifies the ec2_instance module defined in the ./ec2-instance-module directory.
Replace the region value with your desired AWS region.
role_name specifies the name of the IAM role to be associated with the EC2 instance.
role_assume_policy defines the trust policy allowing EC2 to assume the specified IAM role.
policy_arn is the ARN of the IAM policy to be attached to the IAM role.
ami specifies the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use for the EC2 instance.
instance_type defines the EC2 instance type.
key_name is the name of the key pair used for SSH access to the instance.
instance_tags is a map of tags to be assigned to the EC2 instance.
Note: Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your own values according to your requirements.

Please refer to the appropriate module documentation for further information on the ec2-instance-module used in this example.
